            Beijing (CNN)Former flight attendant Chai Cheng still has nightmares about the moment of passion that cost him everything.

            In October 2019, footage was leaked online of Chai kissing a male pilot from the same airline -- China Southern, the country's largest carrier.

            Both men were off duty, and the kiss -- which has since been viewed millions of times -- occurred in an elevator in a private apartment building.

            As the clip spread online, Chai was quickly grounded by the company and eventually let go.
            He is now suing the airline for lost wages, in a case that is seen as a test of China's stance on workplace discrimination.
